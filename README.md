Web Crawler Project
Intelligent Web Crawler
An AI-powered web crawler designed to intelligently scrape, extract, and structure data from multiple websites based on user-defined prompts. This tool is optimized for handling complex website hierarchies, dynamic content, and generating clean, structured output ready for integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

Features
Intelligent Crawling: Navigate website hierarchies and dynamic content based on user prompts.
Selective Data Extraction: Focus on specific content such as FAQs, pricing pages, or forms.
Structured Output: Deliver extracted data in JSON, plain text, or CSV formats for seamless integration.
API Support: Easily integrate the crawler into larger RAG pipelines.
Web Interface: A minimal, user-friendly interface to input prompts, set crawling depth, and download data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed on your machine.
Git for version control.
A virtual environment tool like venv or conda.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-web-crawler.git
cd intelligent-web-crawler
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the initial test script to ensure the setup works:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
1. Basic Crawling
The crawler accepts a URL, a user-defined prompt, and crawl depth. Example:

python
Copy code
from crawler import Crawler

crawler = Crawler()
data = crawler.scrape(
    url="https://example.com",
    instructions="Extract FAQs and product details",
    depth=2
)
print(data)
2. API Integration
Run the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Access the crawler API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/scrape/.

3. Web Interface
Launch the web interface by running the server:
bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.
Input the URL, prompt, and crawling depth, then download structured data.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Playwright: For handling dynamic content and complex web structures.
BeautifulSoup: For HTML parsing and data extraction.
FastAPI: For building an API for the crawler.
Uvicorn: For running the FastAPI server.
Future Enhancements
Add authentication support for private websites.
Implement machine learning models for better prompt understanding.
Improve web interface design for enhanced usability.
Challenges and Solutions
Dynamic Content Handling: Used Playwright to handle JavaScript-heavy websites.
Error Handling: Added robust mechanisms to manage inaccessible pages and site structure changes.
