        "Departments",
        "Footer menu",
        "Footer Bottom",
        "San\u00a0Francisco, CA \u2014Today, the Board of Supervisors unanimously approved approved legislation put forward by Mayor London N. Breed to eliminate annual license fees for businesses, making it easier to operate, grow, and open a small business in San\u00a0Francisco. This proposal was co-authored and supported by Treasurer Jos\u00e9 Cisneros, and Supervisors Rafael Mandelman and Aaron Peskin.",
        "The announcement builds on Mayor Breed\u2019s continued effort to remove barriers and fees to support businesses citywide. Reducing costs for small businesses was a key goal of Prop M, the new business tax measure approved by the voters in November. Prop M cuts taxes for thousands of small businesses, and revenue from Prop M will be used to cover the permitting costs previously paid by businesses. The fees will be eliminated starting in 2026.",
        "Drafted in partnership with the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector, Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD), its Office of Small Business (OSB), multiple City permitting agencies, and small business stakeholders, the legislation indefinitely waives 49 annual license fees, providing $10 million annually in relief to San\u00a0Francisco business owners.",
        "\u201cTo help small businesses, we\u2019ve cut red tape, we\u2019ve cut taxes, we\u2019ve improved public safety, and now we are cutting more fees,\u201d saidMayor London Breed. \u201cThe transformation we\u2019ve made in helping small businesses to open and operate started with Prop H in 2020, which cut months off permitting and approval times, and continues today with the elimination of these costly fees. San\u00a0Francisco is supporting small businesses like never before, and we must continue to build on this progress.\u201d",
        "Currently, small business owners pay thousands of dollars in annual fees to operate restaurants, food trucks, bars, and bakeries. There are individual charges for outdoor seating, having billiard tables, and extended hours, among others. A business even incurs an annual fee for things like a cash register or having candles in their establishment.",
        "Most of the fees are charged by individual departments and combined on a unified license bill issued by the Office of the Treasurer & Tax Collector. With the passage of this legislation, 91% of restaurants and 87% of bars and nightclubs will no longer receive this annual bill from the City.",
        "\u201cThe elimination of numerous annual license fees will truly benefit small businesses in San\u00a0Francisco,\u201d saidLaurie Thomas, Executive Director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association. \u201cWe are grateful to the Mayor, the Office of Economic and Workforce Development, and everyone involved for recognizing the needs of our business community and taking action to help us survive and thrive.\u201d",
        "The eliminated fees have a disproportionate impact on small businesses. Most fees cost the same regardless of the size of the business incurring the cost, and these fees are generally only paid by smaller businesses, particularly restaurants.\u202fIn contrast, business taxes are progressive \u2013 meaning that smaller businesses pay less than larger businesses.

As usual, we\u2019ve been busy!LGBTQ History MuseumOn October 1st, the Mayor and I introduced legislation to acquire the building at 2280 Market Street between Noe and Sanchez to be used as a permanent home for the LGBTQ History Museum! The road to this point has been a long and winding one. We looked at a number of sites, entered into several letters of intent, requested appraisals of multiple buildings, negotiated with various owners, had our hopes raised and dashed at different points.This journey began more than fifteen years ago, when then-Supervisor Bevan Dufty struck the deal that allowed the GLBT Historical Society to open a museum space in the Castro. Although that space has been a great success and a destination for visitors to the Castro and neighborhood residents alike, we have all known for some time that it would not be the museum\u2019s forever home. Beginning in 2021, Mayor Breed set aside funds in each year\u2019s budget to be used for a permanent home for an LGBTQ history museum befitting San Francisco\u2019s role in the story of queer liberation, culture and politics.Former Supervisor and now State Senator Scott Wiener found $5.5 million in State funding to help make initial improvements to the building and give the GLBT Historical Society a solid start on the private fundraising required to sustain and grow the museum\u2019s operations in the future.Currently we anticipate that the building will be operated in partnership with the GLBT Historical Society and the Community Arts Stabilization Trust, a nonprofit that specializes in supporting cultural nonprofits in the acquisition and operation of real estate assets. Our hope is that in time the GLBT Historical Society will be able to acquire the building from the City, but until that point it will operate the museum under a lease.There is still lots of work to do to close on the property, get the second floor ready for the museum and see the museum open and operating, but it is most exciting to have made it this far.SF Stairway Month and Burnside StepsOne of the fun parts of this work is that we get to celebrate neighborhood beautification projects and citywide civic involvement. This month, we had the chance to do both!You may be familiar with theBurnside Muralin Glen Park and the effort to create a tiled staircase there, led by the relentless Renee Berger (Renee was profiled in our July \u201cFaces in the Crowd\u201d segment). After a long, meandering, and frankly painful journey through our city\u2019s regulatory \u201capproval\u201d process, tiles are being installed this month. Head out to 50-59 Burnside Avenue to see the work in progress and come for the ribbon cutting on October 27 to see San Francisco\u2019s newest tiled staircase!With the impending completion of the Burnside Steps, the many Crosstown Trail-themed events of \u201cCrosstober,\u201d and the best weather of the year coming up, it seemed a perfect time to celebrate the City\u2019s 900+ stairways. So, we wrote aresolutiondeclaring October to be San Francisco\u2019s first-ever Stairway Month! My colleagues on the Board passed the resolution unanimously on October 1st, so get out there and enjoy District 8\u2019s many stairways!

        "If approved, the J Church stops at Clipper and 27th streets would shift to 26th and 28th streets. Shifting these transit stops to even-numbered streets would create more regular spacing that is similar to other stops nearby. For example, the J Church currently has stops at 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 24th and 30th streets. It would also allow for all-way stop signs to be added at 28th Street without delaying trains.

The pilot's aims were to implement an innovative math and teacher development program in four SFUSD schools, to begin to level the playing field for San Francisco\u2019s most vulnerable students. What schools found after two years is that not only did test scores significantly go up in math and literacy, the program is changing school atmospheres for the better, reducing absenteeism, lifting self-confidence and joy of student math learners, and increasing collaboration and\n networking among teachers.",

And again, test scores aren\u2019t everything, but frankly what they are doing is not teaching to the test, they are actually creating a deep pedagogy, curriculum instruction in a safe school environment that is welcoming kids, not teaching to the test and producing test results. That is quality right there, and frankly we have not seen a lot of examples of this so what I would say from the Board of Ed is this would be great to see expanded in order to meet these very ambitious goals\". \u2013 President Matt Alexander, Board of Education, San Francisco Unified\n School District",

While AI has the potential to improve the City\u2019s delivery of services and support innovation, it also poses risks such as bias, misuse, and lack of transparency. By learning from past missteps in regulating technologies like social media, this legislation aims to provide policymakers and the public with a clear understanding of the AI tools in use by City departments and those that may be adopted in the future.As AI adoption accelerates, creating a centralized inventory is critical. While only a few City departments currently procure AI products, many employees already use free tools like ChatGPT.

I understand how concerning this weather can be, and I'm closely monitoring the City's infrastructure.I've reached out to BART, MTA, and SFO to ensure they're prepared for the extended period of intense rain and potential flooding.
